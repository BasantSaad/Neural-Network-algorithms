# ðŸ§  ART1 Neural Network with Streamlit

This project is an interactive Streamlit web app that demonstrates the **ART1 (Adaptive Resonance Theory 1)** neural network algorithm. ART1 is used for **unsupervised learning** and clustering of binary input patterns with a vigilance parameter controlling the similarity threshold.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Dynamically input:
  - Binary **input vectors**
  - Initial **bottom-up weights**
  - Initial **top-down weights**
  - **Vigilance parameter (rho)**
- Visual update of the bottom-up and top-down matrices after learning.
- Error checking for input formats and dimensions.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Make sure to install the required packages before running:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy
