# 💖 Radial Basis Function (RBF) Visualization 💖

This project is an interactive **Radial Basis Function (RBF)** visualization built with **Streamlit**.  
It allows you to visualize how RBF transforms data points with respect to two centers, compute distances and RBF values, and explore cluster assignments.

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Custom pink theme** with heart decorations  
- 📝 Editable **centers** and **data points** from the sidebar  
- 🔢 Automatic calculation of squared distances and RBF values  
- 🧾 Interactive **results table** with all computations  
- 🌄 **3D surface plot** of RBF values  
- 🗺️ **2D contour plot** with centers and data points  
- ⚪ **Scatter plot** of data points with labels  
- 🧮 Tool to **find nearest cluster** for any test point
