# 💖 Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Simulation 💖

This project is an interactive **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)** simulation built with **Streamlit**.  
It allows you to experiment with input vectors, initial weights, and training iterations to visualize the SOM learning process.

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Custom pink theme** with heart decorations  
- 📝 Editable **input vectors** and **initial weights** from the sidebar  
- ⚙️ Adjustable **number of training iterations**  
- 🔢 Display of **initial and final weight matrices**  
- 🔄 **Heatmap visualization** of weight evolution  
- 📌 **Competitive learning scatter plots** over training  
- 📊 **Line plot for weight convergence**
