# 🫧 ANN Girls — Neural Network Algorithms Playground 🫧

This project is an interactive **Streamlit application** that provides a friendly interface to explore and visualize various **Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms**.  
The main front file serves as a dashboard that lets you navigate between different algorithm demos, each implemented in separate files inside the `pages/` folder.
